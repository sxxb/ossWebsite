            Residual Current Devices, or RCDs, are devices that quickly break electrical circuits when the supply current doesn't match the return current. This can indicate current leakage, which can be a shock hazard. A current of just 30 milliamps is enough to cause serious harm when in contact with the human body. Regular testing of fixed and portable RCDs ensures they operate correctly and prevent leakage current from harming you, your employees or your customers.

              A comprehensive RCD test should involve a Ramp Test, and a Time Test. A Ramp Test steadily increases the current to the RCD to ensure it trips at the correct current - generally 30mA. The Time Test will apply a current sufficient to trip the RCD immediately, so the time delay between excessive current and the RCD shutting off can be measured. This ensures that the RCD is tripping at the correct current and will shut off in time when needed.

              At OSS Electrical our experienced technicians will perform <em> both a 6 month “push button” test and 12 month “millisecond” test in accordance with Australian Standards to ensure that these devices are functioning within their design parameters and appropriate standards.
            The information from these tests shall be recorded and reported to you via a “on site” logbook and electronic ‘soft’ copy for OH&S auditing processes.</em>
