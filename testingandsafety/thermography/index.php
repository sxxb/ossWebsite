          <p>Thermography (or thermal imaging) is used to measure the radiant heat patterns which are emitted from electrical components. This can help identify faulty or at-risk components before they cause significant damage.</p>

            <p>
               We can conduct thermal imaging on appliances and machinery to identify points of excessive heat, which may indicate a potential fault. Thermography is often used as a proactive diagnostic tool, which allows the detection of developing faults, before they cause system failure or emergency situation. By identifying problems before they become critical you can save time and money.
