            <p>The energy produced by a microwave oven, industrial dryer or other microwave producing device can penetrate living tissue and cause a range of negative health effects. While a properly operating microwave appliance poses little risk to users, regular testing can ensure that microwave radiation is not leaking from your appliances.</p>

              <p>We can undertake microwave leakage testing using specialised equipment that complies with the Australian Standard AS/NZS 3350.2.25. This testing includes:</p>
              <ul class="service-dot-points">
                <li><span class="service-dot-point-marker"></span>Physical Damage Inspection to ensure correct functioning and safety compliance to Australian Standards.</li>
                <li><span class="service-dot-point-marker"></span>Electrical Safety Testing, to ensure microwave appliances are compliant.</li>
                <li><span class="service-dot-point-marker"></span>Power Output Inspection, which measures the wattage of the oven to ensure that the electrical flow of the unit is operating as expected as per Standard requirements.</li>
                <li><span class="service-dot-point-marker"></span>Radiation Leakage Inspection, involving the measurement of radiation levels around the oven with a microwave specific meter to detect any microwave leakage.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Upon completion of testing, a certification label (indicating radiation and power levels) will be placed on the front of the oven where it can be easily seen. A second certification tag and barcode tag will be placed on the power lead and a detailed inspection report will be provided.
