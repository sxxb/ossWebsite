          <h3>5. Cookies</h3>
          <p>Like many web sites, we use ‘cookies’ and obtain certain types of information when your Web browser accesses our website. This enables our system to recognize your browser and to provide features such as storage of items in your Shopping Cart between visits. We use tracking information to determine which areas of our sites users like and don’t like based on traffic to those areas. We do not track what individual users read, but rather how well each page performs overall. This helps us continue to build a better service for you. We track search terms entered in the search function as one of many measures of what interests our users. We do not track the terms a particular user enters.</p>
          <p>Occupational Safety Services creates aggregate reports on user demographics and traffic patterns for advertisers, sponsors and partners. This allows our advertisers to advertise more effectively, and allows our users to receive advertisements that are pertinent to their needs. Because we don’t track the usage patterns of individual users, an advertiser or sponsor will never know that a specific user clicked on their ad. We will not disclose any information about any individual user except to comply with applicable law or valid legal process or to protect the personal safety of our users or the public.</p>
